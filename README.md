# Prayer App

An application inspired by my own struggles as a Christian living away from home and Matthew 18:20

*“For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.” - Matt. 18:20*

I hope the application brings Christians or anyone who is intrigued or questioning God to come together in prayer, encouraging
one another and bearing one another's burdens.
